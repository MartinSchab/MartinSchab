Hi, I'm Martin Schab, CEO & Founder of Connectome Solutions Ltd.
My GitHub profile showcases my work as the sole developer driving Connectome Solutions. My mission is to advance laboratory management systems for healthcare and forensic services in the United Kingdom and beyond.

I'm developing next-generation cloud-based platforms with a focus on:

Optimizing Medical Laboratory Workflows: a flagship Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) is engineered to enhance efficiency in medical laboratories, with a projected 40% reduction in sample processing times through elimination of bottlenecks and unnecessary work as well as minimising human error during the process. 

Innovating Forensic Pathology Documentation: I am also developing a forensic autopsy system that incorporates integrated 3D visualization, designed to address current inefficiencies and improve the clarity of evidence presentation within the justice system.

My work involves comprehensive analysis of complex laboratory processes, adherence to stringent regulatory compliance standards, and the application of modern technological solutions to positively impact patient care and legal proceedings.

This foundational period is dedicated to intensive product development, informed by strategic consultancy engagements with NHS trusts and private laboratories. This direct engagement ensures our software solutions are precisely aligned with real-world operational requirements.

My commitment: To develop robust software that empowers laboratory professionals, respects their specialised expertise, and contributes to improved outcomes in critical healthcare and forensic domains.

Public repositories here reflect aspects of my technical approach; however, core Connectome Solutions development remains proprietary during this phase.
